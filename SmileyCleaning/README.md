Let's create a simple DMG file placeholder:

```txt file="public/downloads/smiley-brooms.dmg"
This is a placeholder for the Smiley Brooms macOS app (.dmg file).
In a real implementation, this would be an actual macOS disk image containing the app.

The app would include:
- Native macOS interface
- Web view integration with the Smiley Brooms website
- Booking management
- Service browsing
- User profile management
- Notifications for booking updates

System Requirements:
- macOS 11.0 or later
