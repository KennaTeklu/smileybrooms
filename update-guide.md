## **KEY IMPROVEMENTS FOR ROI** üìà

### **Granular Task Breakdown Strategy:**
1. **Floor Cleaning**: Separated into zones (traffic areas, corners, under furniture, baseboards)
2. **Surface Cleaning**: Charged per surface/wall instead of "all surfaces"
3. **Appliance Services**: Individual pricing for each appliance component
4. **Organization**: Separated by area/drawer/cabinet for precise pricing
5. **Specialized Services**: Premium charges for restoration vs. basic cleaning

### **Efficiency Multipliers:**
- **Bulk Task Performance**: Clean all floors together, all surfaces together
- **Premium Material Pricing**: 2-3x markup for luxury materials (marble, leather, etc.)
- **Specialized Equipment**: Justify higher prices with professional-grade tools
- **Time-Based Efficiency**: Quick tasks bundled for maximum hourly rate

### **Revenue Optimization:**
- **Essential Tier**: $113.90/hour average (10-hour job)
- **Premium Tier**: $186.42/hour average (12-hour job)  
- **Luxury Tier**: $286.53/hour average (15-hour job)

**Note for Programmer**:
- Display discount prices in **large green text**
- Show original prices with strikethrough
- Highlight "Save $XXX" prominently
- Use contrasting colors for maximum visual impact
